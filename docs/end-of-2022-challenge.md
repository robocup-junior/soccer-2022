# End of 2022 Challenge 

The end of the year is coming and we decided to give you a chance to
directly participate on the development on SoccerSim. If you are interested,
read further for detailed instructions.

## Results

There was just Team Reset from Taiwan taking the place in this challenge.
Not only they designed an omniwheeled robot, the team also created a dribbler and kicker devices.
[Check out their Pull Request for more details!](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/rcj-soccersim/pull/140)

## Task

If you have ever attended a RoboCupJunior Soccer event, you might have
noticed that many of the robots use omnidirectional wheels
(wheels that can move along two axes) which, in the end,
makes them faster on the field.

In order to make the movements similar to the physical competition,
we would like to introduce omniwheeled robots in SoccerSim as well. Your task is to design
the robot (all 6 robots on the field should look the same) according
to the following rules:

**Requirements**

* All the robots have either 4 or 3 wheels
* All the robots are equipped with all the sensors (IR, GPS, Compass, Ultrasounds) and communication modules
* All the robots are able to react to the ball and play a game (you need to create a simple program for them)

Feel free to use Webots itself for designing the robot. Check
out their [guide](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/menu) and
[documentation](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/index)!
