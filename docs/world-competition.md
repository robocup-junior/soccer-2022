# RoboCupJunior SoccerSim World Championship 2022

RoboCupJunior World Championship 2022 will be held in July in Bangkok,
Thailand. After last year’s success, we would like to continue with the
organization of the SoccerSim challenge this year as well.
The competition will be held virtually, but in an "offline" mode this time,
since most of the committee members will be located at the physical RCJ in Bangkok.

## Competition overview

SoccerSim challenge this year includes:

* Simulation of matches
* Presentation of team description papers
* Solving Technical Challenges.

As usual, teams will be asked to submit the code of their robot players.
We have frozen the `rcj-soccersim` software which is [available as a tagged release
at our GitHub](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/rcj-soccersim/releases/tag/v2.1). This release will be used for simulating the matches.

In order to spread the knowledge, we ask teams to provide team
description papers. These might contain descriptions of team members’ roles,
various approaches you have tried while implementing the code for
simulated robots as well as anything you consider worth mentioning.
For inspiration, feel free to
[check last year's papers out](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/awesome-rcj-soccer#soccersim)!

There will be at most two technical challenges.
`rcj-soccersim` software will be updated appropriately for these challenges.
There will be several days reserved for you to implement your solution
and submit a recorded video. The committee will then review it and evaluate each team on a rubric.

## Rules

The rules are based on the regular RoboCupJunior Soccer rules, adapted to the
simulation environment.

You can find them at
https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/soccer-rules-simulation/blob/master/rules.pdf

**Note**: The rules haven't changed much from the last year. Perhaps the most
important changes include the change of the world's coordinate system and
removal of exact GPS coordinates of the ball. Robots are now forced to sense the ball
using IR sesnsors. We encourage you to check out the
[sample Robot controllers](https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/rcj-soccersim/tree/master/controllers/rcj_soccer_team_blue)
as well as the [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo) documentation.

## Documentation

We now have two full fledged documentation articles that can help you get
started programming your robots:

- [How to program your robot](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccersim/how_to_robot/)
- [Inter-robot communication](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccersim/communication_between_robots/)

If you feel like there is something missing in the documentation, do not
hesitate to suggest a change -- Pull Requests are very much welcome!
